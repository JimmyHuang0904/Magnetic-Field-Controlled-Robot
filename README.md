### Description

This project uses 2 F38x ([C8051F38x](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/8-bit/c8051f38x)) microcontrollers :
* One for the receiver.c which allows the wireless robot to receive and execute commands
* One for the transmitter.c which sends one byte code to signal the receiver through magnetic field

and various electrical components and hardware (to be listed later)
